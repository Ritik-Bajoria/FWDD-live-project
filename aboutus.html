            This is about 35 years back a man started his journey with a tea-coffee stall which became
            the talk of the town. After a few years, he added something along with tea-coffee, so he started
            with 10 pcs of samosa, which became the renowned samosa pasal. People started liking the taste and
            kept coming back to Tip Top for the samosa, which later became Tip Top samosa. Over time, we expanded
            from tea-coffee-samosa to a wide range of sweets and snacks, along with catering services and much more to come.
